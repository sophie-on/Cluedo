/**
 * A DoorSquare is essentially a special type of RoomSquare.
 * It is an entry point to the room it is a part, a room may not be entered via 
 * a RoomSquare. Like any other tile, it takes one move to move to it. However,
 * once a piece does this, it is considered to be in the room and not occuping this tile.
 * 
 * A player must also exit using a DoorSquare. A special DoorSquare exists between corner
 * rooms that lead out to another DoorSquare in the opposite corner room as opposed to a
 * CorridorSquare.
